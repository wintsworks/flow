# Flow
- A more semantic language in the making.
- Keywords shall be concise and give meaning.
- The "Flow" of the algorithm will take place in the function signature.
- Function signature containing logic shall preload this logic in memory,
  in efforts to enhance speed performance.

# Plans
## Just Beginning (4/16/25)
- There's still a lot of work to do, including finding a reasoning for this
  new language, though, there will be a focus in machine learning, especially
  in its standard library.
- I decided on Golang - at first I was debating C, but I love how goroutines operate,
  and the language is more semantic, expressive, and capable out of the box.
- At the very least, Flow will have the ability to host server-side applications.
- will add more here as we go along!
